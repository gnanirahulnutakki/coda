# AI Orchestration Feature Concept

## Overview
Enable one AI assistant (e.g., Gemini) to act as the "user" for another AI assistant (e.g., Claude), automatically handling prompts and corrections.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Orchestrator Mode
```bash
coda orchestrate --driver gemini --worker claude "Create a React app with authentication"
```

### 2. Architecture
```
User -> Coda Orchestrator -> Driver AI (Gemini) -> Worker AI (Claude)
                  ^                    |                    |
                  |                    v                    |
                  +-------------- Feedback Loop -----------+
```

### 3. Driver AI Responsibilities
- Interpret worker AI questions
- Provide clarifications
- Detect errors or issues
- Course-correct the worker
- Validate outputs

### 4. Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Basic Orchestration
```typescript
interface OrchestrationConfig {
  driver: AIProvider
  worker: AIProvider
  task: string
  maxIterations: number
  validationRules?: ValidationRule[]
}

class AIOrchestrator {
  async orchestrate(config: OrchestrationConfig) {
    // 1. Start worker with task
    const workerSession = await this.startWorker(config.task)
    
    // 2. Monitor worker output
    workerSession.onOutput(async (output) => {
      // 3. Driver analyzes output
      const analysis = await this.driver.analyze(output)
      
      if (analysis.hasQuestion) {
        // 4. Driver provides answer
        const response = await this.driver.generateResponse(analysis.question)
        workerSession.sendInput(response)
      }
      
      if (analysis.hasError) {
        // 5. Driver provides correction
        const correction = await this.driver.generateCorrection(analysis.error)
        workerSession.sendInput(correction)
      }
    })
  }
}
```

#### Phase 2: Smart Validation
- Driver AI validates outputs against requirements
- Automatic rollback if validation fails
- Learning from successful patterns

#### Phase 3: Multi-Stage Workflows
```yaml
# .coda/orchestration/create-app.yaml
name: Create Full-Stack App
stages:
  - name: Backend API
    driver: gemini
    worker: claude
    validation:
      - All endpoints must have tests
      - Must include authentication
      
  - name: Frontend UI
    driver: claude
    worker: cody
    validation:
      - Must be responsive
      - Must connect to backend API
      
  - name: Deployment
    driver: gemini
    worker: amazon-q
    validation:
      - Must include CI/CD pipeline
      - Must have monitoring
```

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Complex App Generation
```bash
coda orchestrate --driver gemini --worker claude \
  "Create a full-stack e-commerce app with:
   - Next.js frontend
   - Node.js backend  
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Stripe integration
   - Admin dashboard"
```

### 2. Automated Debugging
```bash
coda orchestrate --mode debug \
  "Fix all TypeScript errors and failing tests"
```

### 3. Code Review & Refactoring
```bash
coda orchestrate --driver claude --worker aider \
  "Review and refactor for performance, 
   following team style guide"
```

## Technical Considerations

1. **Context Sharing**: How to share context between AIs effectively
2. **Token Management**: Could get expensive with two AIs running
3. **Feedback Loops**: Preventing infinite loops or confusion
4. **Error Recovery**: What if driver AI gives bad instructions?
5. **Progress Tracking**: How to show user what's happening

## Proof of Concept

We could start with a simple implementation:

```typescript
// Simple orchestration for Q&A handling
async function orchestrateSimple(task: string) {
  const worker = spawn('claude', [task])
  const driver = spawn('gemini', ['--mode', 'assistant'])
  
  worker.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    const output = data.toString()
    
    // If worker asks a question
    if (output.includes('?')) {
      // Send to driver for response
      driver.stdin.write(`Claude asks: ${output}\nProvide a helpful response:\n`)
    }
  })
  
  driver.stdout.on('data', (response) => {
    // Send driver's response back to worker
    worker.stdin.write(response)
  })
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Autonomous Development**: Set a task and let AIs collaborate
2. **Reduced Human Intervention**: AIs handle clarifications
3. **Quality Assurance**: Driver AI can ensure standards
4. **Learning Opportunity**: See how different AIs approach problems

## Challenges

1. **Cost**: Running multiple AIs simultaneously
2. **Coordination**: Keeping AIs in sync
3. **Context Limits**: Managing token limits for both AIs
4. **Debugging**: Understanding what went wrong in AI-to-AI communication

This feature would make Coda a true "AI orchestration platform" rather than just a wrapper!
