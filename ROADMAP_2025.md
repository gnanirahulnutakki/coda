# Coda Roadmap 2025: Solving Real Engineer Frustrations

Based on extensive research of engineer frustrations with Claude Code and Gemini CLI, here's our roadmap for making Coda the ultimate AI coding assistant wrapper.

## 🚨 Critical Pain Points We're Solving

### 1. **Context Amnesia** (65% of developers' #1 complaint)

**Problem**: AI assistants forget everything between sessions, forcing developers to re-explain context repeatedly.
**Solution**: Persistent context memory that remembers your project history, decisions, and patterns.

### 2. **No Safety Net** (86% worry about AI code security)

**Problem**: Once AI makes changes, there's no easy way to undo without git gymnastics.
**Solution**: Built-in checkpoint/rollback system - like Time Machine for your code.

### 3. **Cost Anxiety** ($200/mo for Claude Code)

**Problem**: Developers burn through tokens without knowing until the bill arrives.
**Solution**: Real-time token tracking and cost monitoring with alerts.

### 4. **Documentation Desert**

**Problem**: AI doesn't know your team's docs, APIs, or internal standards.
**Solution**: Index and search your documentation with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

## 📋 Priority Features

### HIGH PRIORITY - Solving Immediate Frustrations

#### 1. **Persistent Context Memory** 🧠

- **Why**: #1 developer complaint - losing context between sessions
- **How**: Store conversation history, file changes, and decisions in a searchable database
- **Benefit**: No more re-explaining your project structure every session

```yaml
# .coda/memory.yaml
project_context:
  architecture: 'microservices'
  key_decisions:
    - 'Using PostgreSQL for user data'
    - 'Redis for caching'
  common_patterns:
    - 'Factory pattern for services'
```

#### 2. **Checkpoint/Rollback System** ⏮️

- **Why**: Only Replit has this; developers keep "one hand on git revert"
- **How**: Auto-checkpoint before AI changes, one-command rollback
- **Benefit**: Experiment fearlessly, undo disasters instantly

```bash
coda checkpoint create "before refactor"
coda "refactor the auth system"
# Oh no, it broke everything!
coda checkpoint rollback
```

#### 3. **Documentation Integration** 📚

- **Why**: AI misses team standards and internal APIs
- **How**: Index docs, use RAG to inject relevant context
- **Benefit**: AI that actually knows your coding standards

```yaml
# .coda/config.yaml
documentation:
  paths:
    - ./docs
    - ./wiki
    - https://internal-docs.company.com
  auto_include: true
```

#### 4. **Cost & Token Tracking** 💰

- **Why**: Claude costs $200/mo, Gemini wastes tokens on lint loops
- **How**: Real-time token counting, cost projection, daily limits
- **Benefit**: No surprise bills, optimize token usage

```bash
coda stats --cost
# ┌─────────────────────────────┐
# │ Token Usage This Month      │
# ├─────────────────────────────┤
# │ Claude: 2.3M tokens ($46)   │
# │ Gemini: 5.1M tokens (free)  │
# │ Daily limit: 80% used       │
# └─────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 5. **Security Scanning** 🔒

- **Why**: 86% of developers worry about AI-generated code security
- **How**: Auto-scan for secrets, vulnerabilities, anti-patterns
- **Benefit**: Catch security issues before they hit production

```bash
coda --scan "add user authentication"
# ⚠️ Security scan results:
# - Potential SQL injection on line 42
# - Hardcoded API key detected
# Continue anyway? [y/N]
```

#### 6. **Diff Preview Mode** 👀

- **Why**: See exactly what AI will change before it happens
- **How**: Show unified diff, approve/reject/modify changes
- **Benefit**: Full control over AI modifications

```bash
coda --preview "fix the memory leak"
# Shows diff of proposed changes
# [A]ccept all, [R]eject, [E]dit, [S]elect specific changes
```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Workflow Enhancements

#### 7. **Multi-Repository Context** 🏗️

- **Why**: Microservices need cross-repo awareness
- **How**: Link related repos, share context between them
- **Benefit**: AI understands your entire system

```yaml
# .coda/workspace.yaml
repositories:
  - name: frontend
    path: ../frontend-app
  - name: backend
    path: ../api-server
  - name: shared
    path: ../shared-libs
```

#### 8. **Workflow Templates** 📋

- **Why**: Developers need "middle ground" between full auto and manual
- **How**: Pre-built workflows for common tasks
- **Benefit**: Consistent, optimized AI interactions

```bash
coda workflow "add-feature"
# 1. Create feature branch
# 2. Generate tests first (TDD)
# 3. Implement feature
# 4. Update documentation
# 5. Create PR
```

#### 9. **Offline Mode** 🔌

- **Why**: Gemini has timeout loops, network issues happen
- **How**: Cache common responses, work offline
- **Benefit**: Keep coding during outages

```bash
coda --offline "explain this error"
# Uses cached knowledge and local models
```

#### 10. **Test Generation & Coverage** 🧪

- **Why**: AI often skips comprehensive testing
- **How**: Auto-generate test cases, track coverage
- **Benefit**: Maintain quality with AI assistance

```bash
coda test generate ./src/auth
# Generated 15 test cases
# Coverage increased from 45% to 78%
```

### Additional Tool Options

#### 11. **Other AI Providers**

- **Cursor**: Popular VSCode fork with AI built-in
- **Windsurf**: Advanced context management
- **Aider**: Git-aware AI pair programmer
- **Continue**: Open-source alternative

#### 12. **Integration Features**

- **IDE Plugins**: VSCode/JetBrains integration
