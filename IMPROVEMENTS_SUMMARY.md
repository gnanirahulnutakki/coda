# Coda Improvements: Making AI Coding Actually Usable

Based on extensive research of real engineer frustrations, here's how we're making Coda better:

## 1. 🛠️ Similar Tool Options We Can Integrate

### AI Providers We Should Add:

- **Cursor** - The most popular AI code editor (VSCode fork)
- **Aider** - Git-aware AI pair programmer with excellent diff handling
- **Continue** - Open-source AI assistant with strong community
- **Windsurf** - Best-in-class context management
- **Amazon Q Developer** - For AWS-focused teams
- **Codeium** - Fast, free alternative

### Why Multiple Providers Matter:

- **Cost optimization**: Switch between free/paid based on task complexity
- **Specialized strengths**: Cursor for refactoring, Aider for git operations
- **Redundancy**: When one service is down, keep coding
- **Team preferences**: Different developers prefer different tools

## 2. 📚 Default Documentation Path Implementation

### Configuration:

```yaml
# ~/.coda/config.yaml
documentation:
  paths:
    - ./docs # Project docs
    - ./README.md # Main readme
    - ./wiki # Team wiki
    - https://docs.mycompany.com # External docs
  file_patterns:
    - '**/*.md'
    - '**/*.txt'
    - 'API.yml'
  auto_include: true # Auto-inject relevant docs into AI context
  max_size_mb: 10 # Don't load huge files
```

### Benefits:

- **AI knows your standards**: No more explaining coding conventions
- **API awareness**: AI can reference your actual API docs
- **Team knowledge**: Shared documentation = consistent AI suggestions
- **Reduced hallucinations**: Real docs prevent made-up APIs

### Usage:

```bash
# AI automatically includes relevant docs
coda "implement user authentication"
# AI now knows your auth API, security requirements, and team standards

# Search documentation
coda search-docs "authentication flow"

# Force include specific docs
coda --with-docs ./docs/security.md "add password reset"
```

## 3. 🎯 Solving REAL Engineering Frustrations

### Based on Research: Top 10 Features Engineers Actually Need

#### 1. **Persistent Memory** (65% want this)

```bash
# Monday: Explain complex refactor plan
coda "let's refactor the auth system to use OAuth"

# Friday: Continue where you left off
coda "continue the auth refactor"
# AI remembers entire context!
```

#### 2. **Checkpoint & Rollback** (Only Replit has this!)

```bash
# Before risky changes
coda checkpoint "before major refactor"

# AI breaks everything
coda "refactor entire codebase"

# One command to safety
coda rollback
# Back to working code instantly!
```

#### 3. **Cost Tracking** ($200/mo anxiety)

```bash
coda stats --cost
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Today: $3.42 (17,000 tokens)    │
│ Month: $67.83 (340k tokens)     │
│ Limit warning at: $150          │
│ Current rate: $2.26/hour        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 4. **Security Scanning** (86% worry about this)

```bash
coda --secure "add payment processing"
# 🔒 Security scan:
# ⚠️  Line 42: Potential SQL injection
# ⚠️  Line 78: Hardcoded API key
# ✅ Line 91: Properly parameterized query
# Continue? [y/N]
```

#### 5. **Diff Preview** (See changes before disaster)

```bash
coda --preview "optimize database queries"
# Shows exact changes:
  - const users = db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + userId)
  + const users = db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])
[A]pply, [R]eject, [E]dit?
```

#### 6. **Multi-Repo Context** (Microservices reality)

```bash
# Link related repos
coda link ../frontend ../backend ../shared

# AI understands entire system
coda "update user model across all services"
# Updates frontend types, backend models, shared interfaces
```

#### 7. **Offline Mode** (Network issues happen)

```bash
coda --offline "explain this error"
# Uses cached knowledge and local models
# No more "timeout loops"!
```

#### 8. **Test Generation** (Stop skipping tests)

```bash
coda test ./src/auth --coverage
# ✅ Generated 23 tests
# 📊 Coverage: 67% → 89%
# 🎯 Uncovered: error handling in login()
```

#### 9. **Workflow Templates** (Consistent quality)

```bash
coda workflow "feature"
# 1. Create feature branch ✓
# 2. Write tests first ✓
# 3. Implement feature ✓
# 4. Update docs ✓
# 5. Create PR ✓
```

#### 10. **Smart Context Injection** (Stop re-explaining)

```bash
# AI automatically includes:
# - Recent changes (git log)
# - Related files (imports/exports)
# - Documentation (API specs)
# - Test files (for TDD)
# - Error logs (for debugging)
```

## 🚀 Why These Features Matter

### Current Pain Points:

- **Claude Code**: Expensive, but polished
- **Gemini**: Free, but unstable (timeout loops, 50% tokens on lint)
- **Both**: Lose context, no rollback, security concerns

### What Coda Fixes:

1. **Memory**: Never explain your project twice
2. **Safety**: Undo anything instantly
3. **Cost**: Know exactly what you're spending
4. **Quality**: Security scanning + test generation
5. **Speed**: Offline mode + cached responses
6. **Trust**: Preview changes before applying

### Developer Impact:

> "65% of developers say missing context is their #1 AI frustration"

> "86% worry about security of AI-generated code"

> "Gemini generated code, but used 50% of tokens in lint warning loops"

> "Claude finished in 1h17m costing $4.80; Gemini took longer and cost $7.06"

## 📊 Success Metrics

When we've succeeded, developers will:

- **Re-explain context**: 90% less often
- **Rollback disasters**: Within 5 seconds
- **Track costs**: In real-time
- **Feel confident**: 95% trust in AI suggestions
- **Save time**: 3x faster than current tools

## 🎉 The Vision

Coda becomes the **intelligent wrapper** that makes AI coding assistants actually usable in production:

```bash
# The dream workflow
coda checkpoint
coda "implement OAuth with our security standards"
# AI knows your docs, checks security, generates tests
# Preview diff, apply changes, auto-commit
# If anything breaks: coda rollback
```

No more:

- Lost context between sessions
- Surprise bills
- Security vulnerabilities
- Manual rollbacks
- Re-explaining everything

Just code with confidence! 🚀
