Let's look at the latest document @work-on-readme/readme-014.md

We are going to start working on supplemental docs

We will clean up the main docs and create a documeent full of ideas for supplemental docs that we will use later.

Come up with a plan of making the main docs more minimal by pulling things to supplemental docs and clear up any cruft in the main docs based on the list of questions below. Supplemental docs should also be minimal up to and including not creating them for a topic where it's not going to be a big benefit to users.

Go section by section (2nd level heading) and follow these instructions step-by-step:

- Ask these questions
  - Can we remove anything from this to make it more minimal
  - Can we remove anything to a second supplemental document
  - Is anything unclear
  - Is anything unecessary
- Make a more minimal version of the section in the readme and update it
- If needed save any supplemental information we're removing to @work-on-readme/supplemental-docs-ideas.md

At the end we should have a more minimal main readme (store it in readme-015.md), an outline/plan for creating supplemental docs, and a document (@work-on-readme/supplemental-docs-ideas.md) to start from when we work on the supplemental docs.
